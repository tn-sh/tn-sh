I'm a gopher ʕ◔ϖ◔ʔ. I love [golang](https://golang.org/).  
My profile icon is the gopher. The Go gopher was designed by [Renee French](http://reneefrench.blogspot.com/).

My favorite stacks:

- Golang
  - [gin-gonic/gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- Docker / Kubernete
- Open API
- Terraform
- ELK Stack
- Typescript
- Svelte
- React
- ASP.Net Core
